# Makers-BnB

For our first group project we would like to build a web app that allows users to list rooms they have available, and to allow them to hire them out for the night. 

# User Stories

- As a user, so I can access the app, I can create an account.
- As an owner, so I can make money, I would like to list my room.

- As an owner, so I can make more money, I would like to list multiple spaces.

- As an owner, so my listing can stand out, I can attach a description(Name, facilities, price).

- As a owner, so I can manage my bookings, I would like to specify a date range that my listing is available.

- As a customer, so I can go on holiday, I would like to request an available space.
- As an owner, so I can screen my customers, I want to accept the request.

- As an owner, so I'm not double booked, currently booked rooms should not show available.

- As an owner, so I can choose the best customer, I would like to be able to have multiple requests for one room.
